Open Age reads game state from the screen via OCR (no memory injection, no anti-cheat risk) and either auto-advances build order steps based on resource/villager/time triggers, or allows manual advancement via global hotkey.

---

## Features

- **Transparent overlay** that stays on top of the game without stealing focus
- **Build order library** with YAML-based build orders (easy to create and share)
- **Manual step advancement** via global hotkeys while the game has focus
- **Auto-advance** (coming soon) based on OCR reading of in-game resources, villager count, and game time
- **Trigger system** with AND/OR logic for flexible step conditions
- **Configurable hotkeys** for all overlay actions
- **Minimal footprint** targeting <100MB RAM and <3% CPU

## Installation

### Download

Download the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/nikrich/open-age/releases) page:

- **Windows:** `.msi` or `.exe` installer

### Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition running in **borderless fullscreen** mode (the default)

## Usage

1. Launch Open Age
2. Go to the **Library** tab and select a build order
3. The overlay shows the current step with an amber highlight and the next step below
4. Use hotkeys to navigate:

| Action | Hotkey |
|---|---|
| Next step | `Ctrl+Alt+Right` |
| Previous step | `Ctrl+Alt+Left` |
| Reset to start | `Ctrl+Alt+R` |
| Toggle overlay | `Ctrl+Alt+H` |

5. Drag the header bar to reposition the overlay

## Build Orders

Open Age ships with three sample build orders:

| Build Order | Civilization | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
| Scouts (Generic) | Any cavalry civ | Beginner |
| Archers (Britons) | Britons | Beginner |
| Fast Castle into Knights | Any cavalry civ | Intermediate |

### Creating Custom Build Orders

Build orders are YAML files. Place them in your app data directory under `build-orders/user/`.

```yaml
id: my-build-order
name: "My Custom Build"
civilization: Generic
author: YourName
description: "Description of the strategy."
tags: [custom, feudal-aggression]

steps:
  - action: "6 vills on sheep"
    at: { time_seconds: 0 }
    villagers_assigned: { food: 6, wood: 0, gold: 0, stone: 0 }

  - action: "Lure boar"
    at: { villagers: 10 }
    notes: "Shoot boar once, garrison in TC."

  - action: "Click up to Feudal"
    at: { villagers: 21, food_min: 500 }
```

### Trigger Conditions

Each step has an `at` field that defines when it should activate:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `time_seconds` | Game time in seconds |
| `villagers` | Minimum villager count |
| `population_min` | Minimum population |
| `food_min` | Minimum food |
| `wood_min` | Minimum wood |
| `gold_min` | Minimum gold |
| `stone_min` | Minimum stone |
| `mode` | `All` (AND, default) or `Any` (OR) |

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.75+
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/) 2.0+ (also available locally via `npx tauri`)

```bash
cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2"
```

#### Linux system packages

The desktop build needs the Tauri web stack plus a Tesseract install for OCR:

```bash
# Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S --needed webkit2gtk-4.1 gtk3 tesseract tesseract-data-eng

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng
```

`tesseract-data-eng` matters: without `eng.traineddata` the capture loop starts
but every OCR read fails.

#### Wayland / always-on-top

GTK's `set_keep_above` is a no-op on native Wayland, so the window would lose
its stacking place against a fullscreen game. `main.rs` therefore forces
`GDK_BACKEND=x11` (unless you set it yourself): the overlay runs on XWayland,
which is also where the game lives, and `_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE` keeps it on top.
That also lets KWin match the window against a launcher entry.

To get the shield icon in your desktop menu / taskbar, drop the desktop entry
and the icon theme files in place (adjust `Exec` to your build path):

```bash
install -Dm644 src-tauri/icons/icon.svg ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/aoe-overlay.svg
# plus a ~/.local/share/applications/aoe-overlay.desktop with StartupWMClass=aoe-overlay
```

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikrich/open-age.git
cd open-age
npm install
```

### Run in Development

```bash
npx tauri dev      # or: cargo tauri dev
```

### Run Tests

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo test
```

### Build for Release

```bash
npx tauri build
```

Outputs are in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:
- **Windows:** `msi/AoE Overlay_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi`, `nsis/AoE Overlay_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`
- **Linux:** `deb/`, `rpm/` or `appimage/` (`--bundles deb|rpm|appimage`; the
  default `targets: "all"` only applies where the bundler tools are installed)

## FAQ

**Will this get me banned?**
No. Open Age uses read-only screen capture (the same as OBS or any screenshot tool). It does not inject into game memory, modify game files, or send any input to the game. It is indistinguishable from a screen recording app.

**Does it work in fullscreen mode?**
It works in **borderless fullscreen** (the default AoE2:DE setting). Exclusive fullscreen is not supported.

**Can I use it for AoE4?**
Not yet. The architecture supports it, but AoE4-specific calibration and OCR templates are not implemented. Planned for a future version.

**Can I share build orders?**
Yes! Build orders are plain YAML files. Share them however you like, or contribute them to this repo.
